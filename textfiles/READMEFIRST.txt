Don't worry about text files that are in here, I will quickly update them so that they go into this 
folder instead so there is less clutter with the code.  It's a bit of a pain in python to import 
functions in another folder so the least I can do is move the text files.

BTW until this is all resolved and as long as this file exists try not to run any code that generates
text files, or delete them before you push at least, just to keep clutter down.  A lot of these files
aren't or won't be necessary either so I will be cleaning that up as well.
